# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome! I'm excited to share my thoughts and ideas with you through this blog.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog covers a variety of topics that I'm passionate about:

- **Technology** - Programming, software architecture, and web development
- **Mathematics** - Beautiful equations, proofs, and mathematical insights
- **Ideas** - Random thoughts and musings on various subjects

## Why I Started This Blog

Writing helps me clarify my thinking and share knowledge with others. I believe that teaching is one of the best ways to learn, and I hope these posts will be valuable to you as well.

## A Quick Math Example

Let's start with something simple. The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with sides $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

This fundamental relationship has applications everywhere in mathematics and physics.

## Some Code Too

Here's a simple TypeScript function:

```typescript
function fibonacci(n: number): number {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

# Using Cursor for git Workflows

- **Staging & commits**: Stage specific files/hunks, create commits, amend commits
- **Branch management**: Create, switch, merge, rebase branches; resolve merge conflicts
- **History exploration**: Search commit history, find when bugs were introduced, blame specific lines
- **Undoing changes**: Revert commits, reset to previous states, recover lost work
- **Interactive rebase**: Squash, reorder, edit, or drop commits
- **Cherry-picking**: Apply specific commits from other branches
- **Stashing**: Save work-in-progress, apply stashes
- **Remote operations**: Push, pull, fetch, manage remotes
- **Reviewing diffs**: Analyze changes between branches/commits
- **Writing .gitignore**: Set up ignore patterns for your project
